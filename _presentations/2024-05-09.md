In this talk, I demonstrated the [Geometric Characterization Workflows](https://github.com/digital-porous-media/geometric_characterization) with a hands-on tutorial. The workflow contains three different notebooks with the contributions of three other collagues from the Digital Porous Media Team of the University of Texas at Austin. These notbooks are as follows:
1. Minkowski Functionals;
2. Heterogeneity Measurement;
3. Competent Subset Selection.
